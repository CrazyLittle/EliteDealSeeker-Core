This is the EliteDealSeeker "core" code - the code that visits websites and
parses their forum posts.

The best way to get started is to look in central_settings for the list of
websites to visit. Choose one 'site_name' and supply it as a parameter to
the test_site.pl script.

Example:

C:\temp\EliteDealSeeker-Core>perl test_site.pl dslreports
site:     dslreports
category: computers
visiting: http://www.dslreports.com/forum/forsale
html len: 75845
$VAR1 = [
          [
            'http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25065676-FS-iPhone-4-32-GB-and...
            'iPhone 4 32 GB and iPad 16 GB wi-fi and Mac Mini',
            'dslreports',
            'computers'
          ],
          [
            'http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r23303633-FS-Laptop-AC-Adapters...
            'Laptop AC Adapters',
            'dslreports',
            'computers'
          ],
          [
            'http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25002604-FS-Forsale-Wireless-c...
            'Forsale: Wireless card and 2meter BIRD Watt Meter',
            'dslreports',

Your are seeing perl's printout of the data structure that gets consumed by the
rest of EliteDealSeeker.

With this core code separated away from the rest of EliteDealSeeker, I've tried
to make a very simple environment by which others can add/fix sites/categories.
